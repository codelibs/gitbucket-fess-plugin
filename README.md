gitbucket-fess-plugin: Search All of GitBucket on Fess
==

[**gitbucket-fess-plugin**](https://github.com/codelibs/gitbucket-fess-plugin) is a [**GitBucket**](https://gitbucket.github.io) plugin that provides **global search**, that is, search across multiple repositories.

Users can search for:
* **Code** in all public repositories
* **Code** in private repositories where you can access
* **Issues** / **Pull requests**
* **Wiki** pages

![ScreenShot](images/demo.png)

This plugin cooperates with [**Fess**](https://github.com/codelibs/fess), which is a full-text search server powered by [**Elasticsearch**](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).
But, special knowledge is NOT required to use both Fess and this plugin.

# Getting Started

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Setting Up](#setting-up)
* [Private Repository Search](#private-repository-search)
* [Continuous Crawl](#continuous-crawl)

## Installation
Download `gitbucket-fess-plugin` jar file from [the release page](https://github.com/codelibs/gitbucket-fess-plugin/releases) and
put it into `~/.gitbucket/plugins` (If the directory does not exist, create it by hand).

## Setting Up
After the installation, the admin user sets up both of GitBucket and Fess.

The flow of the setting is like the following:

* [Step 1. Run GitBucket and Fess](#step-1-run-gitbucket-and-fess)
* [Step 2. Generate Token for Crawler @GitBucket](#step-2-generate-token-for-crawler-gitbucket)
* [Step 3. Set up Crawler @Fess](#step-3-set-up-crawler-fess)
* [Step 4. Run Crawler @Fess](#step-4-run-crawler-fess)
* [Step 5. Register Fess's URL @GitBucket](#step-5-register-fesss-url-gitbucket)

### Step 1. Run GitBucket and Fess
Run [GitBucket](https://gitbucket.github.io) and [Fess](https://github.com/codelibs/fess).
If you run the both applications on `localhost`, use different port numbers.

#### Example
##### GitBucket: `http://localhost:8080/gitbucket/`
```bash
$ java -jar gitbucket.war --port=8080 --prefix=gitbucket
```

##### Fess: `http://localhost:8081/fess/`
```bash
$ ./bin/fess -Dfess.port=8081 -Dfess.context.path=/fess/
```


### Step 2. Generate Token for Crawler @GitBucket
Access to `http://[GitBucket URL]/[User Name]/_application` as a GitBucket's admin user and generate an access token.
This token will be used by crawlers of Fess.

![Generate GitBucket's token](images/step2.png)

### Step 3. Set up Crawler @Fess
Access to `http://[Fess URL]/admin/dataconfig/` as a Fess's admin user and set up a data crawler.

Then, fill each form as below:
* Name: String
* Handler Name: **GitBucketDataStore**
* Parameter:
```
url=http://[GitBucket URL]
token=[GitBucket's Token generated in Step 2]
```
You don't have to change other values.

![GitBucketDataStore config](images/step3-1.png)

After you create a configuration successfully, you can find it in `http://[Fess URL]/admin/dataconfig/`.
Then, click it and create a new crawling job.

![Create a new job](images/step3-2.png)

You can set up a crawling schedule here, but you can also change it later.
Thus, if you are new to Fess,ã€€you don't need to change any value here.
(For more details about scheduling, see [a later section](#continuous-crawl).)

### Step 4. Run Crawler @Fess
Move to `http://[Fess URL]/admin/scheduler/`.
Then, you will find the job created in Step 3 on the top of the list.
Choose and start it.

![Start a crawler](images/step4-1.png)

If a crawler starts successfully, the status of the job scheduler becomes *Running* like the following:

![Crawler is running](images/step4-2.png)

Crawling process takes time, depending on a number of contents in GitBucket.
Fess stores codes on the default branch in each repository.
After the crawling job finishes, you can search GitBucket's contents on Fess.

### Step 5. Register Fess's URL @GitBucket
This is the final step.
Access to `http://[GitBucket URL]/fess/settings` as an admin user and register the URL of **Fess's top page**.
Note that the following image uses the URL of Fess started with flags `-Dfess.port=8081 -Dfess.context.path=/fess/`.

You can also register a [Fess's access token](http://fess.codelibs.org/11.0/admin/accesstoken-guide.html) here.
It is required for private repository search, but you can leave this form empty now.
For more details, see [the next section](#private-repository-search).

![Register a token](images/step5.png)

Then, global search will be enabled!

## Private Repository Search
If the admin user registers a [Fess's access token](http://fess.codelibs.org/11.0/admin/accesstoken-guide.html) at `http://[GitBucket URL]/fess/settings`,
users can explore their private repositories.

**How to generate Fess's access token**

Access to `http://[Fess URL]/admin/accesstoken/` as an admin user and
click the `Create New` button.

Next, fill in the form like the following:
* Name: String
* Permissions: empty
* Parameter Name: **`permission`**

![Generate a token on Fess](images/fess-access-token.png)

Then, access token will be created.

## Continuous Crawl
By setting up [job schedulers](http://fess.codelibs.org/11.0/admin/scheduler-guide.html) on Fess,
you can run data crawlers periodically to keep search results up to date.

Access to `http://[FessURL]/admin/scheduler/` and choose a crawler job.
Then, you can setting up the value of `Schedule` in [Cron-format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
